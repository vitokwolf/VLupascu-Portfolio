# VLupascu-Portfolio

## This is my first website built from scratch by myself. 
## Included projects are  examples only (module study and first challenge), I do not own those projects.

### Main features of the code:

* Responsive layout that adapts to 3 screensize breakpoints using media queries;
* Semantics to meet accessibility standards;
* Variables and pseudo-classes for improved visual effects;
